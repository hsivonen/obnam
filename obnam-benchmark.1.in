.TH OBNAM-BENCHMARK 1
.SH NAME
obnam-benchmark \- benchmark obnam
.SH SYNOPSIS
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B obnam-benchmark
benchmarks the
.BR obnam (1)
backup application,
by measuring how much time it takes to do a backup, restore, etc,
in various scenarios.
.B obnam-benchmark
uses the
.BR seivot (1)
tool for actually running the benchmarks,
but makes some helpful assumptions about things,
to make it simpler to run than running
.B seivot
directly.
.PP
Benchmarks are run using two different usage profiles:
.I mailspool
(all files are small), and
.I mediaserver
(all files are big).
For each profile,
test data of the desired total size is generated,
backed up,
and then several incremental generations are backed up,
each adding some more generated test data.
Then other operations are run against the backup repository:
restoring,
listing the contents of,
and removing each generation.
.PP
The result of the benchmark is a
.I .seivot
file per profile,
plus a Python profiler file for each run of
.BR obnam .
These are stored in
.IR ../benchmarks .
A set of
.I .seivot
files can be summarized for comparison with
.BR seivots-summary (1).
The profiling files can be viewed with the usual Python tools:
see the
.B pstats
module.
.PP
The benchmarks are run against a version of
.B obnam
checked out from version control.
It is not (currently) possible to run the benchmark against an installed
version of
.BR obnam.
Also the
.I larch
Python library,
which
.B obnam
needs,
needs to be checked out from version control.
The
.B \-\-obnam\-branch
and
.B \-\-larch\-branch
options set the locations,
if the defaults are not correct.
.SH OPTIONS
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.BR TMPDIR
This variable
.I must
be set.
It controls where the temporary files (generated test data) is stored.
If this variable was not set,
they'd be put into
.IR /tmp ,
which easily fills up,
to the detriment of the entire system.
Thus.
.B obnam-benchmark
requires that the location is set explicitly.
(You can still use
.I /tmp
if you want, but you have to set
.B TMPDIR
explicitly.)
.SH FILES
.TP
.BR ../benchmarks/
The default directory where results of the benchmark are stored,
in a subdirectory named after the branch and revision numbers.
.SH EXAMPLE
To run a small benchmark:
.IP
TMPDIR=/var/tmp obnam-benchmark --size=10m/1m
.PP
To run a benchmark using existing data:
.IP
TMPDIR=/var/tmp obnam-benchmark --use-existing=$HOME/Mail
.PP
To view the currently available benchmark results:
.IP
seivots-summary ../benchmarks/*/*mail*.seivot | less -S
.br
seivots-summary ../benchmarks/*/*media*.seivot | less -S
.PP
(You need to run
.B seivots-summary
once per usage profile.)
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR obnam (1),
.BR seivot (1),
.BR seivots-summary (1).
