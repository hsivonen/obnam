Description: online and disk-based backup application
 Obnam makes backups. Backups can be stored on local hard disks, or online
 via the SSH SFTP protocol. The backup server, if used, does not require any
 special software, on top of SSH.
 .
  * Snapshot backups. Every generation looks like a complete snapshot, so you
    don't need to care about full versus incremental backups, or rotate real
    or virtual tapes.
  * Data de-duplication, across files, and backup generations. If the backup
    repository already contains a particular chunk of data, it will be re-used,
    even if it was in another file in an older backup generation. This way, you
    don't need to worry about moving around large files, or modifying them.
  * Encrypted backups, using GnuPG.
  * Push or pull operation, depending on what you need. You can run Obnam on
    the client, and push backups to the server, or on the server, and pull
    from the client over SFTP.
