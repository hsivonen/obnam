class RepositoryInterface(object):

    '''Abstract interface to Obnam backup repositories.

    An Obnam backup repository stores backups for backup clients.
    As development of Obnam progresses, the details of how things
    are stored can change. This is usually necessary for performance
    improvements.

    To allow Obnam to access, both for reading and writing, any
    version of the repository format, this class defines an interface
    for repository access. Every different version of the format
    implements a class with this interface, so that the rest of
    Obnam can just use the interface.

    The interface is suitably high level that using the repository
    is convenient, and that it allows a variety of implementations.
    At the same time it concentrates on the needs of repository
    access only.

    The interface also specifies the interface with which the
    implementation accesses the actual filesystem: it is the
    Obnam VFS layer.

        [rest of Obnam code]
                |
                | calls RepositoryInterface API
                |
                V
        [RepositoryFormatX implementing RepositoryInterface API]
                |
                | calls VFS API
                |
                V
        [FooFS implementing VirtualFileSystem API]

    The VFS API implementation is given to the RepositoryInterface
    implementation with the ``set_fs`` method.

    It must be stressed that ALL access to the repository go via
    an implemention of RepositoryInterface. Further, all the
    implementation classes must be instantiated via RepositoryFactory.

    The abstraction RepositoryInterface provides for repositories
    consists of a few key concepts:

    * A repository contains data about one or more clients.
    * For each client, there is some metadata, plus a list of generations.
    * For each generation, there is some metadata, plus a list of
      files (where directories are treated as files).
    * For each file, there is some metadata, plus a list of chunk
      identifiers.
    * File contents data is split into chunks, each given a unique
      identifier.
    * There is optionally some indexing for content based lookups of
      chunks (e.g., look up chunks based on an MD5 checksum).
    * There are three levels of locking: the list of clients,
      the per-client data (information about generations), and
      the chunk lookup indexes are all locked up individually.
    * All metadata is stored as key/value pairs, where the key is one
      of a strictly limited, version-specific list of allowed ones,
      and the value is a binary string or a 64-bit integer (the type
      depends on the key). All allowed keys are implicitly set to
      the empty string or 0 if not set otherwise.

    Further, the repository format version implementation is given
    a directory in which it stores the repository, using any number
    of files it wishes. No other files will be in that directory.
    (RepositoryFactory creates the actual directory.) The only
    restriction is that within that directory, the
    ``metadata/format``file MUST be a plain text file (no encryption,
    compression), containing a single line, giving the format
    of the repository, as an arbitrary string. Each RepositoryInterface
    implementation will work with exactly one such format, and have
    a class attribute ``format`` which contains the string.

    There is no method to remove a repository. This is handled
    externally by removing the repository directory and all its files.
    Since that code is generic, it is not needed in the interface.

    Each RepositoryInterface implementation can have a custom
    initialiser. RepositoryFactory will know how to call it,
    giving it all the information it needs.

    Generation and chunk identifiers, as returned by this API, are
    opaque objects, which may be compared for equality, but not for
    sorting. A generation id will include information to identify
    the client it belongs to, in order to make it unnecessary to
    always specify the client.

    File metadata (stat fields, etc) are stored using individual
    file keys:

        repo.set_file_key(gen_id, filename, REPO_FILE_KEY_MTIME, mtime)

    This is to allow maximum flexibility in how data is actually stored
    in the repository, and to make the least amount of assumptions
    that will hinder convertability between repository formats.
    However, storing them independently is likely to be epxensive,
    and so the implementation may actually pool file key changes to
    a file and only actually encode all of them, as a blob, when the
    API user is finished with a file. There is no API call to indicate
    that explicitly, but the API implementation can deduce it by noticing
    that another file's file key, or other metadata, gets set. This
    design aims to make the API as easy to use as possible, by avoiding
    an extra "I am finished with this file for now" method call.

        The point of this is to allow the repository implementation
        to provide, say, a checksum that can be used instead of the
        whole data. This allows the caller to discard the data and
        do call put_chunk_into_indexes later, without excessive
        memory consumption. Also, the equality guarantees allow the
        caller to do de-duplication of chunks.

        to both the chunk ids (possibly several!) and the client ids
