        # We lock everything. This is to avoid a race condition
        # between different clients doing backup and forget at the
        # same time. If we only lock the client we care about, plus
        # the chunk indexes, the following scenario is possible:
        #
        #       1. Client A locks itself, plus chunk indexes, and
        #          starts running forget, but slowly.
        #       2. Client B locks itself, and starts running a backup.
        #          It merrily uses chunks that A thinks are only used
        #          but A itself, since B hasn't updated the chunk
        #          indexes, and can't do that before A is done.
        #       3. Client A finishes doing forget, and removes a number
        #          of chunks, because nobody else was marked as using
        #          them. However, some of these chunks are now being
        #          used by B.
        #       4. A commits its changes.
        #       5. B gains lock to chunk indexes, and commits its changes.
        #
        # At this point, the chunk indexes indicate that B uses some chunks,
        # but A already removed the chunks.
        #
        # By locking all clients during a forget, we prevent this race
        # condition: nobody else can be running a backup while anyone is
        # running a forget. We also lock the client list to prevent a new
        # client from being added.
        #
        # This is not a great solution, as it means that during a
        # forget (which currently can be quite slow) nobody can do a
        # backup. However, correctness trumps speed.
