Installing Obnam
================

This chapter explains how to install Obnam. It is not a very extensive
set of instructions, yet. In particular, itreally only caters to
Debian users. Instructions for other systems would be very much welcome.

Debian
------

It is easiest to install Obnam on a Debian system. If you're running
Debian `wheezy` or a later release, Obnam is included and you can just
install it:

    apt-get install obnam

There may be a newer version of Obnam on the author's site. The rest
of this section explains how to install from there.

Add the following line to your `/etc/apt/sources.list` file:

    deb http://code.liw.fi/debian squeeze main

Then run the following commands as root:

* `apt-get update`
* `apt-get install obnam`

The commands will complain that the PGP key used to sign the archive
is not known to apt. You can either ignore this, or add the key from
<http://code.liw.fi/apt.asc> to your key, after suitable verification.

Other systems
-------------

For other systems, you need to install from sources. See the `README`
file in the source tree for instructions.
