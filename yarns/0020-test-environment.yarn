Test environment and setup
==========================

This chapter describes the environment that is set up for the tests to
run in: how live data is generated, where it is kept, where the
repository is kept and accessed, how verification of results happens,
etc. This chapter is required reading for anyone wanting to understand
what happens in the test suite.

The DATADIR directory
---------------------

Yarn provides a directory temporary test data, and sets the
`DATADIR` environment variable to point at that directory. The Obnam
test suite uses that completely.

Live data
---------

Many Obnam tests require generating some data to be backed up, which
we call _live data_. Some tests will require modifying that data, for
testing multiple backup generations. We use the [genbackupdata] tool
to generate bulk data: it supports modifying an existing data tree, as
well as just generating data.

We care about not just the amount of data, but also how it is
distributed, all kinds of file metadata, and all types of filesystem
features that may affect backups. For example, sparse files verse
dense ones; extended attributes; empty files; and symbolic links. We
generate these using a small helper utility program that comes with
Obnam, called `mkfunnyfarm`, which creates a small directory tree with
all the interesting kind of filesystem objects we know about.

Some filesystem objects require root permission to create: device
nodes, for example. For these, we assume that the unit tests are
sufficient: they can inspect the execution of the relevant code paths
in much more detail than integration tests.

We store the live data we generate in `$DATADIR/live-data`. In a
scenario that involves multiple clients, each client has its own set
of live data at `$DATADIR/$CLIENT.live-data`.

Repositories
------------

The backup repository is stored at `$DATADIR/repo`. In a scenario that
involves multiple clients, each client has its own repository at
`$DATADIR/$CLIENT.repo`.

The repository is accessed either via the local filesystem, using the
directory name described above, or over the `sftp` protocol over
`localhost`, using a URL of the form `sftp://localhost$DATADIR/repo`.
For this to work, the user running the test suite needs to have ssh
access over localhost, without requiring a password to be entered.
The user may disable such tests when the test suite is running,
by asking yarn to set the `OBNAM_TEST_SSH` to `no`.

Obnam configuration
-------------------

In the tests, Obnam is run without a default configuration
(`--no-default-config`), to avoid the user's settings affecting the
test suite, or, indeed, having the test suite accidentally wreck the
user's backup repository.

The shell library for the Obnam test suite provides a `run_obnam`
shell function, which runs Obnam in the right way for the tests. All
tests that run Obnam MUST use `run_obnam`. In addition to adding the
`--no-default-config` option, it also tells Obnam to use the
`$DATADIR/obnam.conf` configuration file, for single-client tests, or
`$DATADIR/$CLIENT.obnam.conf` for multi-client tests.

Encryption keys
---------------

For tests that use encryption, we use pre-generated keys (see
`test-gpghome` in the Obnam source tree), because generating keys is a
heavy, slow operation.

Result verification
-------------------

We verify backups by multiple methods:

1. Restore the data, and compare the restored data with the original.
2. Use the `obnam verify` command.
3. Run `obnam fsck` on the repository after any operation that may
   have change the repository.

The verification is done by using the [summain] checksum/manifest
tool, written for this purpose. We run summain against the live data
before making a backup, and again on the restored data, and then
compare the two manifests (with diff). If they're identical,
everything went well, otherwise there's a problem somewhere.

IMPLEMENTS sections
-------------------

The IMPLEMENTS sections are where the nitty-gritty details is
specified of what happens for each scenario test step. The sections
fall into two classes: generic ones, and those specific to a scenario
or small set of scenarios.

The generic ones are discussed and shown in their own chapter. The
ones specific to some scenarios are kept with the scenarios using
them.
